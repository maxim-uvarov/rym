	information about the statistics of site visits and other data without
	using the web interface, 'Logs API' allows to receive non-aggregated data and 
	'Compatible with Google Analytics Core Reporting API v3' allows 
	receive information about site traffic and other data using field names 
	from Google Analytics Core API.	For more information see official
